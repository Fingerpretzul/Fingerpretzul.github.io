            <p>
                The title of this page is a little strange, "The Information Age." What I mean by this is that this page will be all about
                the spread of information. The aspect of American culture that the Internet has had the biggest effect on. Not just the speed and reach of how
                information spreads, (which I already cover in detail in <a href="socialmedia.html#catalyst">social media</a>) but more importantly putting the
                ability of spreading information into the hands of everyone. Before, in order to tell the world you needed to publish something in a newspaper,
                or write a book. But now it's as easy as clicking a button on a free app. This has had both good, and bad effects.

            <h2 id="memes">Memes</h2>
            <p>
                The most middle school essay introduction is the dreaded Oxford Dictionary, but in this case it is vital to understand what a Meme actually is.
                Merriam-webster dictionary defines it as "an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture." This is more akin
                to it's original meaning, but here I'm interested in the fact that webster has actually updated it's definition to a more accurate, modern term. "an amusing or interesting item (such as a captioned picture or video) or genre of items that is spread widely online especially through social media."
                Both of these definitions are correct, but in the case of the internet I think the most accurate definition would be a blend of these 2.

            <p>
                The idea of a meme has really evolved since the term was first coined by Richard Dawkins. Now, I would say that a Meme is a cultural concept (wether that be an Image, video, phrase, etc.), usually comedic in nature,
                that is repeated and imitated, spreading from person to person. With each imitation usually adding it's own twist and modification on the meme itself, making it almost evolve in a way. The modified memes, if they are deemed funny
                and worth spreading by the masses, get passed around and grows more allowing for even more chances for change and growth. Unfunny memes and jokes are not spread, and "die." The lifecycle of memes bears a striking resemblance to concepts
                of Survival of the Fittest.
            </p>
            <p>
                But no matter how funny a meme has, or how much potential it has for funny modifications, every joke gets old. When memes get old, and unfunny they stop being spread and they die. This is the reason I refer to a meme as having a "Lifecycle."
                The lifespan of a meme, has been drastically reducing over the years as social media has evolved itself, becoming more widely used giving more people exposure to these memes. Bad Luck Brain here to my right was spread and became popular in  early 2012, reaching peak
                popularity within a few months. This meme didn't lose popularity and die till possibly* as late as 2016. While now a days, a new meme can be lucky to be spread around more than a few months after it's creation.

            </p>
            <p>
                But what do memes have to do with American culture? Well lot's actually. Humor is how humans connect with each other, it is the way that we lighten the dark times and appreciate the good ones.
                Memes provide a way for humor to be spread among millions, telling jokes for the entire country to see. These memes can make fun of and bring light to serious issues, spread news of current events, or even rally millions
                to go out of their way "For the meme." Take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze">Game stop short squeeze</a> in early 2021, or the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/27/20879010/storm-area-51-alienstock-event-photos">area 51 raid of 2019</a>.
                Neither of these events were organized by one central figure** but instead by thousands of memes circulating, spreading information to the masses. Decentralized information spreading, and organization. Which if you think about it
                is incredible. Hundreds of people showed up to the gates outside Area 51 on September 20th of 2019, no one person in charge but instead thousands of people who had all agreed to show up to this place at this time through memes.
            </p>
            <div class="footnote">
                *Possibly. Culture, humor, all of this is incredibly fluid, hard to pin down stuff. I'm basing this mostly off search results and what little personal experience I have. This isn't a hard science.<br>
                **This isn't <i>entirely</i> true, but for our sake it is. The person who originally proposed the idea of raiding Area 51 on facebook did host a music festival called Alienstock.
                planned by this person.

            <p>
                The ease of spreading information has had negative effects as well. The biggest one being the epidemic of false information, or "Fake News." You may ask, why has this become such a prevalent issue so recently? Well a couple of factors.
                We are now at the point, where anybody can instantly share any article they happen to stumble upon without needing to even read anything more than the headline. This leaves very little time for most people to fact check the information they're
                sharing before they share it. Another factor is that with the rise of online advertisements, news sites now mostly base their metrics on how many users they were able to get to click on their site. This heavily incentivises headlines that 
                may stretch the truth a bit but are attention grabbing. But, this isn't something new to America. We've seen "Yellow Journalism" similar to this in newspapers for years, so whats changed? anonymity  
            </p>
            <p>
                When a newspaper has a blatantly false headline or story, it gains a bad reputation and people stop reading it. But on the Internet, there are thousands of news websites. I could go start my own news blog in about 5 minutes if I would like too.
                And I could do this completely anonymously. The over saturation of news sites and the anonymity of those running these sites means it doesn't matter when a smaller news site posts a blatantly false headline as long as it gets those clicks.
                All it takes is one misleading headline, that your racist grandma Linda finds outrageous (How dare those [insert political party here] do this!?) and decides to retweet. If its believable enough, it spreads around, the truth doesn't stop angry retweets.
            </p>
            <h2 href="conspiracies">Conspiracy Theories</h2>
            <p>
                Didn't you hear? It's all the governments fault! They're all cannibalistic pedophiles, and they're tracking us with microchips in the vaccines*! Only Vermin Supreme (the only politician who would never lie to us) can save us now! This, sound far fetched right?
                I'm hoping everyone realizes the obvious flaws in logic with these arguments, yet there are people out there who really believe this. Most of the things I just said (minus the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin_Supreme">Vermin Supreme</a> comment) are the real beliefs
                of a political organization called QAnon. QAnon started, you guessed it, on the Internet. It is an incredibly far right organization that believes these things, among others such as the idea that Donald Trump was unfairly voted out of office in the 2020 elections.
                This was the organization primarily behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack">January 6th Insurrection</a>. The internet is a breeding ground for crazy conspiracy theories like this. The theory that Vaccines cause Autism, or that the Earth
                is flat and that the government is hiding that from us, all the birds were replaced with government drones in the 60s by nixon, I could go on. This has close ties to the previously mentioned issue of misinformation. Clickbait headlines, and anonymity make it incredibly easy to spread false information, and with enough traction
                these can get big. Back to the example of QAnon, the Anon even stands for "Anonymous." The conspiracy theory was started by an anonymous user named "Q Clearance Patriot" claiming they had high level government clearance, and begun "preaching" these "truths." There is no evidence
                this Q person is who they say they are, and there doesn't need to be. Something completely unique to the internet.
