                The internet is something people tend to find incredibly nebulous, yet is used as an every day part of our lives. You will interact with the internet 10s to 100s of times throughout the day. Wether it's being used to talk to a friend, order a meal, browse
                Social Media there really isn't much you can't do on the Internet. You can even order Drugs through the mail if you know where to look, or if narcotics aren't up your alley we also have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yodelling-Pickle-Bundled-Love-Pickles/dp/B095GNQSHF/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3341F4IATZIRZ&keywords=Yodelling+pickle&qid=1651635403&sprefix=yodelling+pickle%2Caps%2C110&sr=8-4">Yodelling Pickles</a>                for the price of an expensive McDonalds meal. The reach of the Internet in our daily lives means that everybody you meet is going to have some presence of the Internet, and this is true for countries as well. America has made a great effort
                to turning the internet into their new Wild West, attempting to spread American ideals, laws, and more importantly culture into this new digital space. For the most part this has been quite successful. But as the internet has grown it's
                roots into everyone's lives, it has begun to grow and mutate into a culture of it's own.

                Something that is important to understand about the Internet as I continue to elaborate on the effect it has had on culture, is that it doesn't physically exist. The thing we call "The World Wide Web" is just the connections made between computers,
                and the algorithms, rules, and protocols that control how they are supposed to interact with each other. Also note that in the scale of countries its quite young, only about 30 years old. Because of these facts, the global
                reach of the web, and the fluidity and speed of which the internet evolves, America has little to no control over it. The internet has a unique place in American culture because of this, The majority of influence on the Internet comes
                from the average person, and major corporations.
            </p>
            <p>
                One last distinction I should make is the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web. It is a very common misconception that they are two names for the same thing.
                The internet is the network that connects everybody's computers together, while the World Wide Web is the actual websites and data traveling on the Internet.
                This may not seem like an important difference right now, but it will come up a few times so just remember that they aren't the same thing.

                Through the many categories I have presented on this website, I will make the argument that the Internet has had some of the greatest effects on American culture since the creation of the printing press.
                 Never before have ideas, concepts, and messages been able to reach so many Americans in such a short time span and America is still trying to catch up with the rapid pace of which our culture now evolves and reacts to influences through the internet. 
                 I will also argue that the Web is America's new wild west, and still to this day is control over important aspects being fought over by countries and corporations.

                    Utah was among one of the first computers ever hooked up to the internet! When the first computers were connected up to (what was then called the ARPANET) in 1969, there were 4 nodes. They were,
                    <ol>
                        <li>The University of California, Los Angeles</li>
                        <li>SRI International's Augmentation Research Center, California</li>
                        <li>The University of California, Santa Barbara</li>
                        <li>The University of Utah, Salt Lake City</li>
                    </ol>
                    This ARPANET is what would later be the basis for the Internet as we know it today, and the University of Utah was one of the first! (See <a href="history.html#arpanet">History</a>)
                </li>
                <li>The algorithms that search the internet on a internet browser such as Google are called Spiders. Because they search "The Web."</li>
                <li>The majority of internet use isn't done by humans, but instead by bots and viruses. These account for two-thirds of internet activity</li>
                <li>Some of the first and most influential computer scientists were Women, including who is technically the first ever Computer Programmer (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/in-celebration-of-ada-lovelace-the-first-computer-programmer/">Ada Lovelace</a>)
                and the woman who invented the first programming language that would go on to make the Internet possible. These women often go underappreciated in the male dominated field that Computer Science is today.</li>
                <li>The first "computer" was the Difference Engine, developed by Charles Babbage in 1822</li>
