            <p>
                The origins and creation of the Internet are incredibly complicated. It is the culmination of many innovations from a variety of incredibly smart people.
                But as incredible these inventions may be, they really aren't important for the point of this website. My goal is to show the great effect the internet has had
                on American culture, and while knowing the timeline of the Internet is important for this, you don't need to know the specific details of how it came about. As such
                I will only be including a timeline from the creation of the internet to now, with some paragraphs on moments I feel are important such as AOL, and the purpose of the ARPANET.       
            </p>

            <h2 id="arpanet">(D)ARPA* and the ARPAnet</h2>
            <p>
                The Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, was founded by president Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1958 for "Forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science,"
                (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA">Wikipedia</a>). It's creation was directly caused by the launch of Sputnik, the first artificial Earth satellite was created by the Soviet Union and launched in 1957.
                This is fascinating because this was one of the first acts of engagement in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race">Space Race</a> from America. ARPA's true purpose was to compete technologically
                with the Soviet union. ARPA early on would contribute to many innovations we still use today (such as GPS), but where we're concerned comes into play in 1969.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the late 60s, ARPA would establish one of the first Packet Switching networks. Packet Switching was at the time a new technology (that I won't go into detail on, but you can read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">here</a>)
                but is still heavily in use today and is the backbone of computer communication. This network would be called the ARPANET, and would be the beginning of the internet**. This network would expand to connect computers for US military and researchers around the country. In the beginning, it would just be 4 computers from different
                research institutions (Including the University of Utah!), but would eventually expand to have over 30.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ARPANET project would be formally decomissioned in 1990, after the NSFNET project became the basis of internet useage for government agencies and research institutions. But it's legacy was crucial for the future of the internet,
                introducing the core concepts of a widespread network.
            </p>
            <div class="footnote">
                *ARPA Would eventually be renamed to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, becoming DARPA, in 1972.<br>
                **The internet is more of a concept than a real thing. Calling the ARPANET the internet isn't completely correct and incredibly simplified, but it did lay the groundwork for the future internet.
