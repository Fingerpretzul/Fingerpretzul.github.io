            <p>
                Social media is the purest representation of what the Internet does to American culture. As of 2021, 72% of U.S. Adults used some type of social media, with that number being even higher for teenagers. Social media allows anybody, anywhere, to get their opinions and their voices out into the world for anybody to see.
                This results in a fast, radical change in the way that we communicate with eachother. It has broekn down the geographic barriers of community. I can now connect with my friend who lives 800 miles away, as quickly as if we were right next to eachother. Entire communites get formed with people all around the world, something that was incredibly difficult if not
                impossible before. And the speed of which this information can flow has had an equally profound effect.

            <p>
                This leads into the tagline of this sight, "Culture's Catalyst." It is surprisingly apt, with a Catalyst being a substance that speeds up a reaction. Social Media gives ideas an uprecidented idea and reach, the ability to be seen by thousands, millions within seconds. The concept of going Viral is an idea of the internet because its only been possible with the internet.
                The unexpected effect of this phenomenon is that the lifetime of virality has decreased significantly. When information spreads literally at the speed of light, people get bored fast. Andy Worhol is credited with saying "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes"* This is more true than he could have ever imagined.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has had a incredible effect on not just american culture, but culture all around the world. And I believe this is the biggest impact that the widespread growth of Social Media has had on the world as a whole.
                I will reference the effects of this stimulating effect of the Internet many times throughout this page, and a few times throughout the rest of the page. While this effect is present throughout the entire internet,
                Social Media is where this phenomenon can be seen the strongest.
            </p>
            <div class="footnote">*Andy Worhol probably never actually said that, but for fun lets pretend he did</div>
            <h2 id="AIM">AIM</h2>
            <p>
                Let's begin at the beginning, AOL Instant Messenger (Widely known as AIM, or AOL messenger) was the first widespread Social Media platform,* and for many people their first experience with the internet.
                AIM was released in 1997, and was a software that simply allowed you to send text messages in real time to your friends. This became incredibly popular, as the ability to talk
                in real time over the internet was an incredibly new thing, and became especially popular among teens and college students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although AIM rapidly lost popularity in the late 2000s and early 2010s (Due to more accessible and easier to use messengers, such as iMessage), something that has this big of an
                effect and gets used by millions for years sticks around. Elements of the AIM software have been tightly ingrained in memes, videos, and overall culture. For example, everyone reading has most likely
                heard these sound effects somewhere in their life, and they have become instantly recognizable.
            </p>
            <div class="footnote"> *There was a few things that you could consider to be Social Media that was around before AOL, but AOL was the first one that was used by lots of people</div>

            <h2 id="modern">Modern Social Media</h2>
            <p>
                Social Media apps are some of the most prevalent internet using apps on our phones today. Such apps include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and so many others. There are so many different apps out there, that many have begun to build
                reputations for being used by certain groups of people. Reddit was built for free-speech obsessed Libertarians, 4-Chan is infamous for their "Hacker" user base* and the hacker group Anonymous, and Facebook is now stereotyped as only being used by older people, "boomers"
                Part of social media's original boom in popularity was the fact that most had no target demographic, or the demographic of Everyone. But since everyone is on the internet, and everyone uses social media, communities have been built by the users of certain social medias.
            </p>
            <p>
                What does this mean for American culture? Well, a whole lot it turns out. Social media's widespread adoption has lead to the filtering of information. No, I'm not saying the government is constantly monitoring
                what we say to change public opinion (See <a href="information.html#conspiracies">Conspiracies</a>). People tend to seek out information they agree with due to confirmation bias, and social media makes this easier than ever. Now you can join communities where you are surreounded
                by people who think the exact same as you, and this can lead to extreme tunnel vision of ideas. Then enter Targeted Algorithms**. Not only are you already seeking out videos, blog posts, tweets and what not that fit your ideals, but the companies hosting them are spoon feeding them to you
                because they know it is what you like. The longer you stay, the more profit they make, so they give you exactly what you want to see. This is kind of a terrifying thought, but a thought for another time. What's really important about these is the fact that it creates even more tunnel vision,
                and builds up more walls between differing ideas, making you much less likely to see world views that oppose your own
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's explain this with an analogy. Imagine you really like dogs, but hate cats. You're gonna start reading dog magazines, you're going to start looking up dog care blogs and
                and talking about how much you like dogs online. Now lets imagine the huge Dog corporation (because that's definitely a thing that exists) catches wind of how much you like dogs** and begin sending you discounts on these dog magazines in an attempt to make you buy more.
                In this scenario you are going to be surrounded by nothing but information reinforcing your love for dogs, and your hate for cats. You will see messages about how cats eat babies, and are evil monsters who will eat your soul. Is this all true? Who cares, everyone seeing this only cares
                about dogs and would love for more reasons to hate cats.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe this has contributed greatly to the huge divide between the 2 major parties in the current American political system. When you are constantly fed information that reinforces your world view, true or not, it can radicalize people further for their view.
                It is incredibly important to keep this in mind, 
            </p>

                *This stereotype is most likely due to the extreme anonymity of 4-Chan, and the fact that it came about very early in Internet history (2003) when primary users were very technically adept.<br>
